# C_Language_Exercises_Kernighan_And_Ritchie
Exercises and solutions based on The C Programming Language book by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

Personal practice exercises to improve C programming skills and understanding of fundamental C concepts.

## What does the project do?
It provides:
- Practice exercises from the legendary K&R C book
- Examples of common C constructs and idioms
- Solutions organized by chapter for easy navigation

## Why is it useful?
This project is helpful for:
- Beginners learning C programming from scratch
- Students following the K&R book curriculum
- Developers who want to strengthen their C fundamentals
- Anyone looking to practice problem-solving in C

## Prerequisites
- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Copy of "The C Programming Language" book (recommended)

## How to get started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KinKout/C_Language_Exercises_Kernighan_And_Ritchie.git
2. Open the exercises using your preferred IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Community, VS Code).
3. Compile and run the programs using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
